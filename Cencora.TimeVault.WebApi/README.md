# WebApi

Welcome to the WebApi project for TimeVault! This repository contains the implementation of the Web API for TimeVault, built using the ASP.NET Core framework. The Web API provides a robust and scalable interface for interacting with the TimeVault service, enabling efficient access to timezone information and facilitating seamless integration with various applications and systems.

The WebApi project is designed to offer a comprehensive RESTful interface for TimeVault, allowing users to perform operations such as retrieving timezone data, managing geographical coordinates, and performing time conversions through a set of well-defined API endpoints. By leveraging ASP.NET Core, the WebApi ensures high performance, security, and flexibility in handling requests.

## Key Features:
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Access timezone information and perform operations using a set of RESTful endpoints. The API follows standard practices to ensure ease of use and integration.
- **ASP.NET Core Framework**: Built on ASP.NET Core, the WebApi benefits from its performance optimizations, cross-platform capabilities, and built-in support for modern web standards.
- **Secure and Scalable**: The API is designed with security in mind, incorporating features such as authentication, authorization, and input validation to protect against common vulnerabilities. It is also built to scale efficiently, accommodating growing traffic and data loads.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation is provided to help developers understand and utilize the available endpoints effectively. This includes details on request formats, response structures, and error handling.
